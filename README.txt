De-novo Reference Package Pipeline

Under development.

Installation
============

First, install binary dependencies:

* Python 2.7

    - pip, for installing python dependencies (http://www.pip-installer.org/)
    - Python packages:

        + Run ``pip install PACKAGE`` for every PACKAGE listed in requirements.txt, e.g.
          ``cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 pip install``

* uclust 1.1
* Infernal version 1.1, (http://infernal.janelia.org/)
* pplacer suite (http://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer)
* FastTree 2 (http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Install)

Finally, install::

    python setup.py install

UCLUST, pplacer, FastTree, Infernal, and R are all distributed with the `QIIME
Virtual Machine <http://www.qiime.org>`_, which may be a great way to get started.

De-novo reference set creation
==============================

Similarity-search based reference sequence selection

Running
-------

The ``deenurp`` package under the current directory provides to subcommands,
accessed via the script ``deenurp.py``, or the command ``deenurp`` if installed.

Subcommands fall into two general categories:

* Building a set of reference sequences for use in refpkg building
* Selecting sequences for a specific reference package

Creating a sequence set for refpkg building
-------------------------------------------

``deenurp filter-outliers``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Removes sequences from a reference database that are more than a specified
distance from the centroid of their tax id.

``deenurp expand-named``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Expands poorly-represented names in a sequence file by similarity search

``deenurp cluster-refs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cluster reference sequences, first by tax-id at a specified rank (default:
species), then by similarity for unnamed sequences or sequences not classified
to the desired rank.  Serves as input to ``search-sequences``.

Selecting sequences for a reference package
-------------------------------------------

``deenurp hrefpkg-build``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Builds a set of hierarchical reference packages.

``deenurp search-sequences``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Searches a set of sequences against a FASTA file containing possible reference sequences.

This subcommand does searches sequences against a reference FASTA file, saving
the results and some metadata to a sqlite database for use in
``select-references``

``deenurp select-references``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given the output of ``search-sequences``, ``select-references`` attempts to find a
good set of reference sequences.

For each reference cluster  with a minimal amount of sequences having best hits
to the cluster, (see ``cluster-refs``), selects a set number of sequences to
serve as references.

``deenurp fill-lonely``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Taxa who are the sole descendent of their parent can complicate taxonomic classification.

The ``fill-lonely`` subcommand finds some company for these lonely taxa.

``deenurp add-reps``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fetches sequences from a sequence file which match the taxtable for a reference
set at a given rank. Useful for adding type strains.

``deenurp tax2tree``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runs the ``tax2tree`` program on a reference package, updating the ``seq_info``
file.

Sequences whose lineage changes are relabeled. The prior ``tax_id`` is added to
the ``seq_info`` file in the reference package.
